  questions: [
    {
      question: "What is the Proposal Process in Arbitrum DAO?",
      answer: `Arbitrum DAO's proposal process requires a minimum token holding, distinguishing between Constitutional and non-Constitutional proposals. AIPs should be well-structured with sections like Abstract and Specifications. If rejected, proposals can be resubmitted with changes and explanations. Code changes necessitate pre-proposal code submission. In essence, the process involves meeting criteria, crafting structured proposals, resubmitting as needed, and providing necessary code for implementation.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Who Can Submit Proposals in Arbitrum DAO?",
      answer: `In Arbitrum DAO, to submit proposals, individuals with an Ethereum wallet address representing at least 1,000,000 tokens (approximately 0.1% of votable tokens) can participate in the proposal process`,
    },
    {
      question: "What Types of Proposals Are Accepted in Arbitrum DAO?",
      answer: `In Arbitrum DAO, various types of proposals are accepted, including Constitutional and non-Constitutional proposals. Constitutional proposals modify the text or procedures of the Constitution or AIP-1, while non-Constitutional proposals cover other types like fund requests or community guidelines`,
    },
    {
      question: "Can I Propose Changes to Existing Protocols or Features",
      answer: `Yes, you can propose changes to existing protocols or features. In the context of Arbitrum DAO, individuals can submit Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (AIPs) to suggest modifications or enhancements to the network's governance, smart contract lockup schedules, spending, budget transparency, and more. These proposals allow community members to actively participate in shaping the evolution of the protocol and its features.`,
    },
    {
      question: "How Can I Participate in Proposal Discussions?",
      answer: `To participate in proposal discussions in Arbitrum DAO, you can create a new topic in the forum under the Proposal Discussion category. By titling your post with [RFC] - Your Team Name - Your Proposal Title and linking to the post in a comment below, you can increase discoverability and engage with the community.

A proposal passes if more votes are cast in favor than against, and the total number of votes cast in favor is at least 5% for a Constitutional AIP or 3% for a non-Constitutional AIP of the votable tokens.
