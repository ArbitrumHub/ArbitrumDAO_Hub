description: "Funding will involve partnering with Farcaster builder KOL and channels, allowing real users to vote by 'Liking' on Farcaster. Popular voting is done by quality users and work streams; expert voting by top builders as measured by Github, onchain, and social graph. Tools include Farcaster and a Tenfold whitelabeled Arbitrum builder client. Methodology differs from contests like Rounds.wtf and Jokerace, addressing past issues like spam. No further development funding is necessary."
