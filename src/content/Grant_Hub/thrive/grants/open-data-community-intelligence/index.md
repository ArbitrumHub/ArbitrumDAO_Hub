### Why the Program Was Funded

This program was designed by Plurality Labs to :

- Address the specific need of fraud detection for incentive programs which must utilize open data
- Create a "drop box" for data analysis requests from the community which can be done by the community
- Promote the expectation and culture of open data over closed and proprietary systems
- Tap into an existing ecosystem of data experts with knowledge about onchain forensics and adversarial systems-

---

### Rounds & Milestones

Round 1 - Open data hackathon post STIP to conduct fraud & wash trading discovery.

Round 2 - Establish "permissionless suggestion box" for community-led analysis

Conduct post program analysis, post results on forum, execute compliance, send payments

### Decision Mechanism

The decision of what to fund is made using two mechanisms: 1) A novel open suggestion box which then is voted on by "ODC Jedis" as a quality analysis and 2) a hackathon judged by experts to reward novel discoveries. Both mechanisms leverage hats protocol.
Open Data Community is the only data organization with experience conducting realtime exploratory fraud analysis for adversarial systems. A long term incentive program will benefit from both detecting, defining, and evaluating potentially fraudulent behavior and the effects of the deterrent when participants know this is taking place.

**The program supports experiments to see ifâ€¦**

- Exploring permissionless suggestion boxes.
- Shaping on-chain mechanisms using Hats protocol.
- Hosting on-chain hackathons using Allo voting.-

### Expected Outcomes

- Encourage the Arbitrum community to create and share tools that help ARbitrum grow.
- Expand the group of data analysts and scientists working with Arbitrum.
- Make community analysis more open and decentralized.
- Deliver practical open-source Sybil and grant analysis, including reviews and program management of the STIP analysis.
- Support critical ad-hoc data needs of the Arbitrum community.
