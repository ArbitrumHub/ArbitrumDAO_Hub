- Reward contributors for taking useful actions
- Market important events and opportunities to contributors

### Decision Mechanism

The decision of what to award is made using the Program Manager’s expert discretion. Thank ARB auto-validates, auto-rewards, and auto-records actions taken on-chain or off-chain via an API or oracle. Attestations for each action are sent on Arbitrum One. Each validation happens on another software with another purpose. These included JokeRace, Gitcoin, Push Protocol, Ethelo, Karma, and human validations using Thrive Protocol.

**The program supports experiments to see if…**

- Improve how grant funding is distributed.
- Increase delegate and community confidence that funds are allocated as intended based on a collaborative process.
- Assure the community that we can manage the grant process inclusively and efficiently.-
