### Why the Program Was Funded

This program was designed by Plurality Labs to :

- Make an agreement with Gitcoin to prioritize deployment of Allo protocol on Arbitrum and integration to the Grant Stack interface.
- Attract new audiences to Arbitrum via Gitcoin which may find a home on Arbitrum or generate transaction fees
- Market Arbitrum in a positive way in the Web 3 community

### Rounds & Milestones

Round - Based on the 300k match for matching pools agreed to in the milestone 1 proposal, create eligibility criteria, solicit rounds, execute compliance, and send payments.

Conduct post program analysis, post results on forum, execute compliance, send payments

### Decision Mechanism

The decision of what to fund is made by the program manager setting eligibility criteria (as an expert in fraud on Gitcoin) & approval from Plurality Labs team as a check for potential problems in original criteria.

In return for Gitcoin deploying on Arbitrum asap, we committed 300k ARB to match matching pools for rounds which chose to deploy on Arbitrum. This gives Arbitrum marketing support, directly attracts new users to Arbitrum, and creates transaction fees.

**The program supports experiments to see ifâ€¦**

- There are new ways to acquire matching pools.
- We can identify unconventional marketing channels for Arbitrum, especially for Gitcoin to deploy on Arbitrum.-

### Expected Outcomes

- Boost quadratic funding rounds which can generate gas fees on Arbitrum.
- Encourage Arbitrum protocols to organize quadratic funding for their communities.
- Convert more end users to Arbitrum.
