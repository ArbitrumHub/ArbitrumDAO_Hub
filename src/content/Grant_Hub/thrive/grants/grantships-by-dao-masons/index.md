title: Grantships by DAO Masons
description: "Grant Ships is an ‘evolutionary grants game’ - a.k.a. The plurality meta-framework - where Grant Ships (grant-giving subDAOs) compete to best deploy capital in the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem. The goal is to continually improve how we allocate capital by learning which Ship models are most effective, who the talented actors are, and which allocations resonate with Arbitrum DAO voters. High performing Grant Ships (as signaled by Arbitrum token votes) are rewarded with more capital to deploy in following rounds."

### Why the Program Was Funded

This program was designed by Plurality Labs to :

- Build a meta-allocation mechanism that combines known quality components
- Provide iterative design opportunities for meta-allocation which depends on community participation
- Utilize Hats Protocol and gamification to allow access and provide a fun experience

### Decision Mechanism

The decision of what to fund is made using competitive game mechanics leveraging evolutionary selection pressure.
Grant Ships is a "meta-allocation" program. In a pluralist program, we need ways to democratically decide how much to allocate to different programs. This could be used for workstreams, incentive programs, and many other use cases.

**The program supports experiments to see if…**

- Community can allocate well at a grant program.
- What kind and how many wallets need to participate to produce credible outcomes.
- The combination of hats protocol and molochDAO V3 creates emergent effects, novel outcomes and new insights.

### Expected Outcomes

- Meta allocation software is built and tested. Community led allocation decisions possible.
