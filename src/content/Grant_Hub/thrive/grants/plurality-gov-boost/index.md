### Why the Program Was Funded

This program was designed by Plurality Labs to :

- Utilize Plurality Labs delegated decision making freedom to use different decision making modalities to fund needed work
- Fund research and milestone based work using milsetone based payouts.
- Anticipate future needs of the DAO and build, processes, procedures, and programs which may have substantial impact on the DAO but lack other ways of being funded

---

### Rounds & Milestones

Round 1 - Respond to the current needs of the DAO for milestone-based project to provide services anticipated as needed by Plurality Labs

Conduct post-round analysis & post results on the forum. Create on-chain mechanisms to fund and hold accountable. Create potential next-step pathways.

### Decision Mechanism

The decision of what to fund is made using Program Manager's expert discretion.
GovBoost started from Plurality Labs recognizing DAO needs and anticipating future issues. These grants are HIGH impact expenses that we feel are needed and would not be easily funded with the current DAO mechanisms outside of our ability to experiment with funding models.

**The program supports experiments to see ifâ€¦**

- Data-driven approaches to funding grants is effective.
- Research to show how to avoid governance capture.

### Expected Outcomes
