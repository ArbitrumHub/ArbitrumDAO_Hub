### Why the Program Was Funded

This program was designed by Plurality Labs to :

- Directly address urgent needs of the DAO
- Utilize Plurality Labs delegated freedom to use different decision making modalities to plug operational gaps
- Ensure that people driving efforts can put in the required hours to do quality research and discovery work
- Experiment with Hedgey Grant Token Streams to provide a novel autonomy and accountability mechanism

### Rounds & Milestones

Round 1 - Respond to the current needs of the DAO for individuals to provide currently needed services as indicated by the DAO. Primarily to support ongoing DAO efforts.

Conduct post-round analysis & post results on the forum. Create on-chain mechanisms to fund and hold accountable. Create potential next-step pathways.

### Decision Mechanism

The decision of what to fund is made using the Program Manager’s expert discretion.

Based on the urgent needs of the DAO which first became apparent after Camelot's proposal failed. Plurality Labs hosted the first STIP proposal session and found Tnorm who needed some guarantee of payment to take on the 10-20 hours/wk he thought would be necessary to see it through. (Narrator: It was more…) The second use was for the Treasury and Sustainability group to get started researching and prioritizing. The mechanism was intended to use Hedgey Token Grant streams to give autonomy to the recipient, but the delays in compliance didn’t allow for this test to happen.

**The program supports experiments to see if…**

- Self management and autonomy advance DAO outcomes.
- There are new ways to implement checks, balances, and feedback loops between different parts of the system like Plurality labs, the grant security multi-sig, and the DAO.
- Using on-chain payments such as Hedgy can improve operational efficiency. Due to compliance timing, some firestarters were given as direct grants.
