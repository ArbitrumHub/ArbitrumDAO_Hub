### Decision Mechanism

Quadratic Funding is the optimal way to let the community participate in deciding how to allocate public goods funding. In this experiment, we took learnings from Gitcoin’s citizens round such as individuals only (no orgs). This small-scale test was also in response to how many people contributed to support STIP in unpaid ways.

**The program supports experiments to see if…**

- Rewarding individuals is more effective than rewarding organizations.
- Quadratic funding to is useful in distributing grants retroactively.

### Expected Outcomes

- Individuals are recognized by the community and awarded ARB for contributing to our growth in a meaningful way, establishing a precedent that meaningful work is fairly and appropriately rewarded.
