### Why the Program Was Funded

This program was designed by Plurality Labs to :

- Support Questbook program success based on them answering that the "reason they would not succeed if they didn't"
- Show how pluralist programs can be complimentary to each other.

### Rounds & Milestones

Round 2 - Run 4 Quadratic Funding Rounds concurrently and post results

### Decision Mechanism

The decision of what to fund is made using quadratic funding. First, we hosted a round on Ethereum mainnet using Quadratic Funding for Meta-allocation, the decision of how to split 100k ARB between the 4 domain pools. Because these rounds were designed to support the Questbook program, the 4 domains selected by Questbook were used. In the following 4 quadrative funding rounds, the eligibility criteria matched Questbook’s eligibility criteria. They were all run on Arbitrum One.

**The program supports experiments to see if…**

- Decentralized meta-allocation improves how the community decides to allocate funds between matching pools using quadratic funding.
- Allow-list restricted voting in quadratic funding is useful.
- Collaborative efforts between different programs have positive effects

### Expected Outcomes

- Support initiatives on Arbitrum.
- Find high-quality grants that might get additional funding from Questbook if the grant is successful.
- Minimize the risk of choosing grants that might fail.
