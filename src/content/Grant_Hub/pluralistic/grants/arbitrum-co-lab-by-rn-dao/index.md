### Decision Mechanism

The decision to select the fellows and supporting mentors is made by experts. The follow-up decision to allocate grants to the most developed projects at the end of the program will use a TBD novel mechanism )likely designed during the program). This program is our biggest wildcard. We are taking a shot at supporting another DAO. An up-and-coming research DAO which can already boast early successes.

**The program supports experiments to see if…**

- Exploring new ways to apply traditional deliberation methods in the Web3 space is useful, viable and feasible.
- AI-based tools can help scale and automate the facilitator’s cycle facilitation and discovery cycles.
- A support network of mentors will lead to better results

### Expected Outcomes

- Build collaboration technology that enhances organizational, community, DAO operations and governance tools.
- Improved group decision making and responsive decision making ventures.
