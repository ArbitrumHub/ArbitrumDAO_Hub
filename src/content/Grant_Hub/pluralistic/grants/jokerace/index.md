### Why the Program Was Funded

This program was designed by Plurality Labs to :

- Experiment with end-to-end onchain decision mechanisms, especially open-submissions
- Fund an exciting and accesible program with clearly defined qualifying conditions and multiple opportunities for iteration and recursion.

### Decision Mechanism

The decision of what to fund is made using a Jokerace contest with 8 rounds of iterative improvements to the round settings.
Jokerace has an onchain dapp which allows the program manager to select initial conditions which then fully execute onchain. In this experiment, we allow a program manager to conduct 8 rounds of iterative improvements to round settings. To fully understand the end-to-end onchain process, we will also need to run experiments at the program level initial settings as well.

**The program supports experiments to see if…**

- The experiments we are funding are also community-driven
- What emerges and what is the impact when we rely on the community to decide what experiments to try and what to prioritize.

### Expected Outcomes

- See how well this decision-making process works compared to other methods, like giving direct grants or using quadratic funding.
