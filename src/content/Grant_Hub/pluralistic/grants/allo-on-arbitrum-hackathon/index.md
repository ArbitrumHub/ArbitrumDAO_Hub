### Why the Program Was Funded

This program was designed by Plurality Labs to :

- Enable new onchain allocation strategies and interfaces which can be used by all 500+ protocols building on Arbitrum
- Support more projects to exist on the Allo protocol project registry to create consistent open data standards for future community review and evaluation
- Discover new grant evaluation interfaces and mechanisms
- Support more decision making modalities to be available for use and testing in Thank ARB governance and potentially for Arbitrum DAO governance if successful-

### Rounds & Milestones

Milestone 1 - Discovery to create challenges

Round - Conduct Hackathon

Conduct judging, post results on forum, execute compliance, send payments

---

### Decision Mechanism

The decision of what to fund is made using a committee of expert judges.
This program focused on getting onchain allocation and review tools built which are needed by the community. It was not highly focused on experimentation.

**The program supports experiments to see ifâ€¦**

- Using innovative voting methods to decide how to distribute prizes for the hackathon is effective

---

### Expected Outcomes

- Our goal is to give the 460+ protocols building on Arbitrum new ways to fund their communities. We want these funding methods to be fully on-chain, transparent, and auditable.
