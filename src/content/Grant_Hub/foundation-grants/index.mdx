### Benefits for Foundation Grant Recipients

More than simply a capital infusion, the Foundation Grants Program works to provide comprehensive support to projects building across the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem. Besides Funding, Recipients of Foundation Grants can expect to receive:

- Access to a community of other driven and passionate Arbitrum DAO contributors as part of our Builders telegram group.
- Recurring communication with seasoned digital asset professionals throughout the life of your grant, supporting continuous project growth and progress towards your milestones.
- Opportunities to showcase your projects across the broader Arbitrum DAO ecosystem once relevant milestones are completed or the project has demonstrated significant progress towards their goals.

For projects who successfully complete their Foundation Grants by reaching all of their milestones, collaboration continues with the Arbitrum Foundation, where additional growth and networking opportunities are available to ensure that project success does not stop once the grant does!

### How much funding should I request?

Most approved grants fall within $10,000.00 to $150,000.00 in ARB tokens. Please refer to the [Grant Types](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Grant-Types-b8d304453e804deba3a9abd058ed6daf) for more details on how much funding you can request. Larger grant requests are subject to a more rigorous assessment process, and in many cases, would be more appropriately sourced from other funding channels, including but not limited to VCs and/or going through the DAO governance process via a non-constitutional proposal for a grant from DAO Treasury.

### Which applications are currently accepted?

Applications for the Foundation Grants Program can be submitted across the sub-categories defined in the [Current Phase Categories](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Current-Phase-Categories-a0108619966148b4a9189ecda1a59ef3).

### Current Phase Categories

The Foundation is particularly interested in directing funds towards:

- Decentralised applications (dApps) using [Stylus](https://arbitrum.io/stylus)
- dApps which, potentially, bring millions of users into Web3, directly improving user experience and onchain activity
- Innovative experiments that challenge the status quo of current Web3 products e.g. by unique product differentiation, or unique GTM strategy

<div class="bg-primary-light p-5 mb-5 lg:mb-10  rounded-lg">
  #### Phase Two (January 2024 - March 31st, 2024)

In the current phase, we are welcoming applications from dApps and Appchains. Phase 2 is set to close at the end of March. In April, we will launch Phase 3. This next phase will continue to focus on dApps and also introduce a more standardized approach to grants: grant tracks. Depending on the stage, growth projection, and type, a project will fall under a specific grant track. Each grant track will consist of defined goals and amounts, increasing the overall transparency and fairness of our program. More information about our grant tracks will be provided soon.
