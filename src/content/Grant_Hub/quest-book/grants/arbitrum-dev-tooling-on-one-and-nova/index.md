### Domain Presentation

**Is my proposal in-scope for this domain?**

The Domain for Developer Tooling on Arbitrum is currently looking for projects that develop toolkits, open-source dApps and documentation for the following categories:

1. **Back to basics:** The Arbitrum blockchain ecosystem is currently in significant need of essential infrastructure to facilitate asset visualization and interaction with the network. In this context, are you poised to undertake the development of the inaugural Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system built upon the Alchemy infrastructure? Alternatively, do you aspire to be the pioneer in the translation of documentation from successful projects within the ecosystem into major languages such as Mandarin, Japanese, Spanish, and French, thus enhancing accessibility and usability?Supporting the development of a robust foundation for Arbitrum. This would empower dApps and protocols to introduce their own metrics systems for evaluating the success and sustainability of their product in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Within the context of this blockchain, it's important to note that Total Value Locked (TVL) may not be the most appropriate metric for assessing the alignment of the protocol with its growth Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).
2. **Bring something cool from another chain to Arbitrum:** Consider the prospect of possessing comprehensive toolkits and Software Development Kits (SDKs) capable of facilitating the creation of applications akin to Lens, Farcaster, or even established protocols like Push. It is a widely acknowledged fact that within the realm of Business-to-Business (B2B) Software as a Service (SaaS), multiple startups often offer similar functionalities. Could one enhance the documentation and develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for such an endeavor more effectively? This vision can be realized by harnessing the capabilities of the Arbitrum blockchain platform.
3. **Addressing the current challenges of Arbitrum:** Centralization, Ecosystem Development and Security are hurdles that are found on Arbitrum. Any documentation to help build sequencers,other developer SDKs to build dApps we've never heard of, and/or any scanner to see and improve the current vulnerabilities in contracts deployed on chain are also welcome to apply.
4. **DevRel:** Streamlining communication between developers and ecosystem stakeholders is key. Do you have any projects that are developer-first? Feel free to also apply in this domain.

### Project Evaluation Criteria

**Milestone articulation:**

All milestones are required to be filled in disbursements following the following disbursement schedule (template): Compound Milestone Tranches - Alcancía.pdf

**What makes a good proposal in this domain?**

- What are you building (less than 400 characters) – We will have follow-up calls to dig deeper about the product. Be concise on the application.
- In which stage is the project currently at? (Extra points if you have already started developing the project)
- Where are you heading with this grant? (Are you looking to turn this into a company or leave it open-source? / are there any plans to continue building this project after a successful grant completion?)
- What are your metrics of success? (This domain will be focused on metrics for pre- and post- deployment of the great proposals)
- Tell us about the team… why you? (link to any references and socials to prove the experience)
- Funding disbursement schedule (provided in milestone articulation)

**Proposal review and evaluation rubric**
Proposals in this domain are typically reviewed directly by the domain allocator. Depending on the proposal content, the domain allocator may consult with allocator(s) in relevant domain(s) and may invite other allocator(s) to provide additional review.

The evaluation rubric consists of five items that are each scored from 0-5 points:

- Team experience:
- Novelty and quality of the idea:
- Relevance to our ecosystem:
- Completeness of the plan:
- Feasibility of goals and timeline:

Proposals that score highly in the evaluation rubric are more likely to be funded, but there is no minimum threshold number of points for funding and no threshold that guarantees funding. Grant decisions are heavily influenced by the evaluation rubric but also take into consideration the balancing of project areas.

## Project Ideas

**Milestone articulation:**

All milestones are required to be filled in disbursements following the following disbursement schedule (template): Compound Milestone Tranches - Alcancía.pdf

**Ideas to build on top of**
Here are some general guidelines or ideas that can be built on top of Arbitrum’s chains and will help you land the grant application:

- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that make it easier for developers to build and deploy applications on Arbitrum.
- Software Development Kits (SDKs) and libraries that provide developers with the tools they need to build applications on Arbitrum.
- Testing and debugging frameworks that help developers to test and debug their Arbitrum applications.
- Monitoring and analytics tools that help developers to monitor and analyze the performance of their Arbitrum applications.
- Documentation and tutorials that help developers to learn how to build and deploy applications on Arbitrum.
- Community forums and support channels where developers can ask questions and get help from other Arbitrum developers.

And some specific product ideas:

- An IDE for Arbitrum’s chains that provides developers with a complete set of tools for building and deploying applications on the platform. The IDE can be a code editor, debugger, compiler, and deployer or simply add support for Arbitrum’s chains to already existing products.
- An SDK for Arbitrum that provides developers with a set of libraries and tools for building applications on the platform. Include libraries for interacting with Arbitrum’s smart contract platform, as well as tools for testing, deploying, and monitoring applications.
- Testing frameworks for Arbitrum that helps developers to test their applications in a variety of environments.
- Analytic tools for Arbitrum that helps developers to monitor the performance of their applications. This tool could provide developers with data on key metrics such as gas usage, transaction times, and user engagement.
- Documentation and tutorial portal for Arbitrum that provides developers with the information they need to learn how to build and deploy applications on the platform. The portal could include documentation on Arbitrum’s API, as well as tutorials on how to build specific types of applications.
- Community forums and support channels for Arbitrum developers. These forums would allow developers to ask questions and get help from other Arbitrum developers.

**What is considered a good proposal application for the Developer Tooling on Arbitrum Domain?**

A good application for a grant in the Developer Tooling on Arbitrum would be a project that helps to make it easier for developers to build and deploy applications on Arbitrum. This could include developing an IDE, SDK, testing framework, analytics tool, or documentation portal for Arbitrum’s chains.

In addition to the above, projects that are focused on making Arbitrum’s chains more accessible to new developers would also be considered for grants. This could include developing educational resources, such as tutorials and articles, or creating tools that help developers to get started with development on Arbitrum, such as boilerplate code or starter projects.

Ultimately, the best way to determine if a project is a good fit for a grant is to contact the grant program directly and discuss your project with them.

**Grant soft-cap amount:** 25,000 ARB
