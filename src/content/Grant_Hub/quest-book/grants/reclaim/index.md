### What is Reclaim Protocol?

Reclaim Protocol (YC W21) uses https session keys to generate zkproofs of users' profile information. It creates digital signatures, known as zk proof, of users' identity and reputation on any website. These digital signatures are computed completely on the client side. This implies that it is private and secure. When a user shares this proof with any app, one can be certain that its authenticity and integrity haven't been compromised.

### Is my proposal in-scope for this domain?

Reclaim protocol has received a grant from the Arbitrum foundation to drive user/dapp adoption on top of Arbitrum. This grants program seeks proposals from Dapp developers who are looking to leverage Reclaim uniquely into their Dapps on top of Arbitrum. New/existing Dapps that take advantage of Reclaim to come up innovative use cases or to supercharge their growth on top of Arbitrum will be prioritised.

**Example of a Dapp that uniquely leverage Reclaim Protocol**

- P2PX - [https://www.p2px.finance/](https://www.p2px.finance/)
- P2PX uses Reclaim to build zk-KYC (using [Aadhar](https://uidai.gov.in/en/) in India) as well as to settle transaction disputes by letting users submit transaction proofs from their bank accounts.
