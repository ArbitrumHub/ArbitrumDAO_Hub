### Vision and Criteria for Grant Proposals

We recognize that communities and the educational realm play an essential role in the growth of an ecosystem, facilitating the onboarding of new members, creators, and developers. However, we're also aware that this domain is one of the most challenging to evaluate its real impact or the quality of its content. We know it can be susceptible to opportunistic practices, such as "farming", and sometimes the budgets presented may be excessive. It's vital for us to adopt a critical approach to ensure funds are allocated to initiatives that genuinely have a positive impact on Arbitrum. With this purpose in mind, we will focus our proposals on the following verticals we believe will be beneficial for the Arbitrum ecosystem:

**Organization of Hackathons:** We're looking for grant proposals aimed at organizing web3 hackathons, specifically in the ecosystems of Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and those building with Arbitrum Orbit. It's essential for us that developers and creators of innovative projects and products begin their journey in Arbitrum. Our goal is to diversify use cases and strengthen the connection with the developer community. We will give special attention to those hackathons that promote the development of tools and products using Stylus. This represents a primary vertical and will be our main focus.

**Initiatives for Institutional Community Growth:** We're seeking proposals aimed at connecting, expanding, and strengthening the Arbitrum community in an academic context, encompassing universities and educational institutions. We're not limited to the software developer community, but we also wish to reach disciplines such as Economics, Law, Political Science, and others. We'll also value initiatives proposing innovations in academic development in collaboration with Arbitrum DAO and governance. We strongly believe that it is essential to integrate Arbitrum into academia and to capture the big brains for the Arbitrum chain.

**Educational Materials and Workshops:** We aim to support proposals focused on developing comprehensive and easily accessible educational resources about Arbitrum. We prioritize long-lasting content aimed at both developers and potential new users. This includes tutorials on programming in Arbitrum and videos breaking down the operations and features of Arbitrum One, Nova, Orbit, and Stylus. Whether in visual, written, or web formats with sections specifically designed for the Arbitrum community, it's vital that these resources be freely accessible and offered for free. We value content in various languages to tighten users' relationship with the Arbitrum ecosystem.

**\*In the educational branch, we won't back sensationalist materials or those about airdrops, ARB token quotations, or fleeting news. Our mission is to promote consistent, long-term educational content.**

**IRL educational events:** We commit to backing live educational-focused events where Arbitrum stands out as the protagonist. We promote geographic diversity; hence, we won't support two consecutive events from one region or the same country - this is obviously subject to demand. Our priority lies in the value and relevance of the content presented at these conferences rather than purely promotional strategies. Moreover, we'll focus our efforts on supporting smaller events (30-60 participants) in emerging or unconventional areas, always maintaining an educational focus.

- **In this sphere, our aspiration is to ensure proper representation of Arbitrum and to ensure budgets are rational and tailored to needs.**

- **We emphasize geographic diversity; our goal is to broaden Arbitrum's horizon beyond established boundaries. Therefore, we lean towards backing smaller initiatives with high potential.**

### Criteria

**Team Composition and Experience:** We'll give special attention to the training and experience of team members, ensuring they possess the necessary skills to execute the ideas or proposals presented. We'll particularly value those who, besides having web3 experience, have a solid and verifiable background in web2. We're convinced of the importance of integrating fresh perspectives from the traditional world. Moreover, it's essential for us that team members are trustworthy individuals with an impeccable reputation. We distance ourselves from granting subsidies to individuals showing fraudulent behaviors or not aligned with Arbitrum's values.

**Innovation and Quality of the Idea:** We'll prioritize educational content distinguished by its high quality, durability, and free accessibility. We'll give special attention to avant-garde proposals that can generate a significant impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. We expect proposals leaning more toward the academic and educational realm than mere advertising. We'll particularly consider ideas involving collaborations with universities and educational institutions.

**Budget and Plan Depth:** We expect proposals with justified budgets and a thorough breakdown of expenses. We'll scrutinize those budgets that seem excessive or contemplate unrelated expenses. We value clarity and detail in financial presentation and the general project framework. We'll also urge applicants to use multisig systems for receiving funds, not only as a security measure but also to ensure resources aren't under the exclusive control of a single address.

**Roadmap and Milestones:** Precision and execution in the roadmap will be essential for our evaluation. We expect proposals to be well-defined, realistic, and feasible. We will not consider those that present ambiguous information or lack clarity. This section is crucial in any proposal, and we demand transparency and meticulousness from applicants. These set milestones will serve as benchmarks, allowing the Arbitrum community to monitor and assess the progress and direction of the proposal.

**Impact, Outcomes, and Metrics:** We anticipate that proposals will include robust methods to assess their impact and the results achieved. We will especially value those that maintain open and consistent communication with the Arbitrum community. We favor proposals that commit to delivering tangible outcomes, whether on-chain or off-chain. It's vital for us that, after a set period, proponents share the metrics and outcomes of their initiatives, emphasizing their significance in the ecosystem.

**Long-Term Perspective:** It's essential for us that proposals present a vision sustained over time, avoiding short-lived or fleeting initiatives. We will highlight those teams or individuals that demonstrate a lasting commitment to Arbitrum. This future-aligned perspective reflects, in our view, the true ethos of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
