### What are Ambassadors?

Arbitrum DAO Ambassadors are members of a two-phased program launched by Arbitrum DAO, an Ethereum layer-2 network. Phase 1, which began on July 13, 2023, focuses on university-based blockchain clubs and students. Successful applicants join the University Fleet and collaborate on building, learning, and educating. Benefits include creating content, organizing in-person events, and proposing initiatives for funding. Phase 2, planned for Q3 2023, targets individuals from the broader community, including developers and enthusiasts, offering financial support for hosting events and opportunities to represent Arbitrum DAO.

### Phases of Becoming an Ambassadors

The timeline for each Phase of the Arbitrum Ambassador Program is as follows:

Phase 1 — University-based Clubs and Students: Today
Phase 2 — Individuals (Community + Technical): Q3 2023

Phase 1 of the Arbitrum DAO Ambassador Program has officially launched. Accepted applicants will be entered into the University Fleet, a collaborative group within the Ambassador Program focused on building, learning, and educating. As an Ambassador, you’ll grow professionally by creating content, hosting in-person events funded by the Arbitrum Foundation, and more. Other things you’ll be able to do as an ambassador include:

- Propose initiatives for funding by the Foundation
- Represent Arbitrum as an official ambassador on your university campus, and beyond
- Make valuable contributions to the broader Arbitrum ecosystem
- Organize and host an Arbitrum satellite event in your region

Phase 2 will provide a framework for community members and developers who are eager to represent the Arbitrum ecosystem but are not affiliated with a university. Ambassadors will have an opportunity to organize and host regional in-person events, develop content, build ecosystem tools, and learn more about Arbitrum technology by being involved in the Ambassador Program. Accepted applicants will be assigned to the Community Fleet or Technical Fleet, which are collaborative groups within the Ambassador Program focused on their respective niches.

### Benefits of Becoming an Ambassador

By becoming an Arbitrum Ambassador you gain access to everything mentioned above, including the ability to:

- Network with others and build your own professional portfolio

The aim is to maintain flexibility and relevance in ambassador participation.
