The Delegate Incentive Program operates on a monthly cycle. At the start of each month, delegate participation in governance activities is tracked. By the last day of the month, delegates must submit their activity data on the forum. They have until the 3rd of the following month to provide a summary of their contributions. The Incentive System Administrator then has 10 days to review, verify, and compile this information, presenting the final results on the forum. Delegates have a 2-day window to dispute any discrepancies. Finally, between the 16th and 17th of the month, a proposal detailing the payment distribution is submitted to Tally for approval. This process is repeated for six months, with payments made in ARB tokens, to assess the system's impact on governance participation.

### What is Delegate Incentive Program?

The Delegate Incentive Program for Arbitrum DAO is designed to boost delegate engagement and participation in the DAO's governance. Running for six months, it offers financial incentives to delegates based on their voting activity, proposal contributions, and communication within the community. The program aims to foster a more active and involved delegate base, ensuring robust governance and decision-making within the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem. Delegates are evaluated monthly, with top performers receiving ARB token rewards, thus promoting consistent and meaningful participation.
