  "Incentive programs in the Arbitrum DAO community refer to initiatives aimed at incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum DAO dApps and attracting new protocols to the platform. These programs are designed to increase the volume, transactions, users, and liquidity on the Arbitrum network, promoting a dynamic ecosystem. ",
  "The Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP) is a grant program developed by the Arbitrum Foundation and community to stimulate usage and attract new projects. The STIP has a budget of up to 50,000,000 ARB tokens, which are distributed to eligible projects through a transparent and accountable process. Additionally, the Arbitrum DAO community has proposed a long-term incentive program that aims to distribute ARB tokens to protocols within a 12-week timeframe, with any remaining funds slated to be returned to the DAO"
