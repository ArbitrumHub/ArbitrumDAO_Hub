### Goals:

The primary goal of the Arbitrum DAO Social Media Fellowship is to enhance and expand the social media presence of the Arbitrum ecosystem through strategic, collaborative efforts. This includes identifying current social media needs, filling communication gaps, and increasing the reach and engagement of Arbitrum DAO across various platforms.

To achieve this, the fellowship focuses on:

Research and Analysis: Investigating how other ecosystems manage their social media, assessing the existing social media outlets of Arbitrum DAO, and gathering data and feedback from delegates and contributors involved in social media activities within the DAO.

Strategic Development: Co-designing a social media strategy that aligns with the current phase of the DAO. This strategy aims to expand Arbitrum's presence on both web3 platforms (such as Lens, Farcaster, LinkedIn) and web2 platforms (such as Instagram, Facebook), tapping into language-specific groups with significant memberships.

Community Engagement and Participation: Empowering the DAO and its community members to contribute to social media efforts. This includes creating a decentralized bounty board where community members can propose and work on valuable ideas.

Decentralization: Gradually decentralizing the management of the social media group to create a "headless" brand for Arbitrum DAO worldwide. This involves enabling the DAO to submit requests to the group, allowing anyone to launch local chapters, and measuring their success through community-driven funding rounds using Quadratic Funding (QF).

Measurement and Evaluation: Tracking key metrics such as member growth, engagement levels, and content performance to evaluate the effectiveness of the social media strategy and make data-driven decisions for future initiatives.

The fellowship meets weekly to ensure continuous progress and collaboration, aiming to propose formal objectives within two months. Ultimately, the goal is to create a sustainable, decentralized approach to social media management that significantly enhances Arbitrum DAO's reach, educational efforts, and digital presence.

### Deliverables

Over a two-month period, the group aims to deliver formalized objectives and proposals for initiatives that will add value to the DAO. These deliverables will be vetted by at least three delegates to ensure quality and alignment with ArbitrumDAO's mission and vision.
