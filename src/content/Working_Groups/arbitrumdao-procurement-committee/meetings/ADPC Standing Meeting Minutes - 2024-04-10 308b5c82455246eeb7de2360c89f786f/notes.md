The Committee also deliberated on mandating that recipients use the funds only through the framework, i.e., selecting whitelisted service providers.

The discussion included providing a high-level overview of the legal document for context before conducting a detailed review, reviewing and revising the legal framework document and RFP template based on internal discussions, finalizing the RFP document by the end of the week, and setting up a communication channel with the Arbitrum Foundation to discuss legal and risk implications of the ADPC signing the agreement.

**5. Security Service Provider Selection Process**

- **Discussion:** The ADPC discussed the process of selecting security service providers for their projects, proposing that project owners choose the service providers through a private tendering process. The discussion included the idea that once the framework is established, service providers and project owners would negotiate terms and prices without further intervention from the ADPC. The Committee discussed a facilitation approach, with the ADPC not being decision-makers for service provider selection or fee negotiation. The discussion also touched on drafting a legal document for the RFP, incorporating the framework and commercial terms, and considering collaboration with a nonprofit security group for initial personnel training.

**6. Security Council Involvement in Arbitrum RFP**

- **Discussion:** The ADPC deliberated on the Security Council's involvement in the upcoming RFP for Arbitrum, acknowledging their role in safeguarding the system but discussing potential conflicts of interest that may arise from direct involvement. The Committee discussed potential members for the Security Council, including reaching out to an academic and former member for their opinion, as well as contacting current Security Council members and other organizations to find suitable candidates with subject matter expertise. The discussion also included the consideration of utilizing in-house personnel from various organizations, despite potential challenges.
- **Resolved:**
  - The ADPC will not directly involve the Security Council in the Arbitrum RFP due to potential conflicts of interest.
  - The Committee will reach out to the identified academic to find suitable members for the Security Council.

**8. RFP Timeline Extension and Prioritization**

- **Discussion:** The ADPC deliberated on the timeline for the pending RFP, discussing the initial consideration of a two-week timeline and the decision to extend it to a four-week period due to the complexity of the contract and the RFP process. The discussion also included the need to prioritize certain service providers and the idea of expediting the procurement process by reducing interview times and holding weekly calls during the evaluation period. The final point of discussion was the extension of the process to six or eight weeks for a more thorough evaluation and onboarding of vendors.
