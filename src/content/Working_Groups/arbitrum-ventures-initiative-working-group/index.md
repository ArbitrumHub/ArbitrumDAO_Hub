title: Arbitrum Ventures Initiative Working Group

description: Arbitrum, amidst a competitive landscape in Web3, aims to leverage its treasury strategically through Developmental Venture Capital (dVC) instruments to foster ecosystem growth. By adopting best practices from matured VC approaches and aligning with its progressive values, Arbitrum seeks to attract top talent, capital allocators, and ecosystem supporters, setting a trend in the industry. To achieve this, it plans to establish specialized programs and instruments, avoiding capture by partners while ensuring win-win outcomes. Key considerations include forming an executive team for efficient operations, establishing oversight by elected DAO representatives, and managing Arb token liquidation to avoid adverse price impact. Case studies and ongoing research inform decision-making, with legal and governance structures under development through collaboration with relevant stakeholders. Next steps involve refining proposals, progressing on legal structures, and engaging with the Foundation and interested parties to align incentives and drive ecosystem growth.

overview: Arbitrum Ventures Initiative, strategically deploys funds to foster innovation, support projects, and nurture developers within the ecosystem.
