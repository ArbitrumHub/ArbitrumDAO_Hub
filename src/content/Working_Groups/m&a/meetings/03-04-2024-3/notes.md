# **I. Main Discussions and Decisions**

1. Operational Structure Amendments

- Went through final amendments to the operational structure:
  - Added the Arbitrum DAO Steering Committee to have oversight over the Mgmt. Co. and will have veto rights over certain actions of the Mgmt. Co.
  - Outlined the responsibilities in detail in the shared document that is in the group.
  - Added the ARDC as the Technical Research Advisory Board to 1) identify targets, 2) continuously refine the targets, and 3) feed into the commercial and technical DD when a deal is being pursued.
  - Added a dedicated legal party; could either be from the AF or a dedicated party. The M&A Mgmt. Co. could procure the outside legal counsel, draw up a budget, and present it to the DAO.
- Most of the mandates of the OpCo could match the M&A WG which could be a tool to execute some of these mandates. This comes down to what, effectively, is the goal - we could merge with an entity for aqui-hire, we could get a marketing company which would match the marketing mission of the OpCo, etc. This could be the execution arm if there is interest in any mandate of the OpCo.

1. Strategic Target Exploration

- Ran through outcome of initial exercise to define key themes and identify areas of interest as targets. This perspective is intended solely as an additional point of reference.
- Should this initiative move further, a comprehensive analysis of target areas will be conducted from both strategic and financial perspectives. Additionally, a widespread survey across the DAO will be carried out to further refine these areas.
- Find output of last weeks exercise below:

## **II. Next Steps**

1. Legal Workstream: Drive Foundation legal workstream \[AF\] + add other legal precedents \[Working Group\] (Check with PaperImperium (insights from MakerDAO holding assets); Northlake (has done work on Equity set-up); dK on OpCo )
2. Solve outstanding topics: ROI measurement; Roles definition; Reporting details; Day-1 Funding ask
3. Share 90% version for review: Involve WG, delegates, foundation, relevant committees
