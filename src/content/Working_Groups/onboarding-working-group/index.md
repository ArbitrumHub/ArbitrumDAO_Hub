title: Onboarding Working Group

description: Arbitrum DAO recognizes the need for more contributors but faces challenges with onboarding due to fragmented information and scattered initiatives. To address this, they propose a 3-month experiment acting as a recruitment agency to match people with opportunities in the DAO. They aim to tackle issues like the lack of an outreach pipeline, scattered initiatives, and initiatives fizzling out by establishing an onboarding hub, a dedicated team, and weekly onboarding calls. This approach seeks to drive increased quality participation, alleviate the workload of existing contributors, and potentially become a long-term initiative for the DAO if successful.

overview: Arbitrum DAO proposes a 3-month experiment to improve contributor onboarding and sustain initiatives. Key components include an onboarding hub, a dedicated team, and weekly calls for engagement. If successful, it could become permanent.
