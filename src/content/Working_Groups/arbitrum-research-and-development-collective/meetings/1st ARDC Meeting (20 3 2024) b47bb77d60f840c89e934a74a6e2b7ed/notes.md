  - Sinkas to create a LettuceMeet link to find a day/time that works for everyone.

**Operational parameters to be implemented according to the original proposal**

- Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;
  - This Notion page was created for this purpose.
- Monthly report detailing the performance of the ARDC.
  - Each member will prepare a written update which will be cross-checked with DAO Advocate and published in this notion page.
- Bi-weekly calls with the community about the ARDC
  - Every month, 2 of the 4 weekly calls of the ARDC will be open to the public. If attendance is big, weâ€™ll set up a separate call for the public.
- Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.
  - Sinkas from L2BEAT to create a dashboard and invite the members of the ARDC so they can update it.
