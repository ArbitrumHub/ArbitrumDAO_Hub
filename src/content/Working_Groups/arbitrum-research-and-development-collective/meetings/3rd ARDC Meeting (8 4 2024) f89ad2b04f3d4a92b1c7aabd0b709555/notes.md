Attendees: Anastassis Oikonomopoulos, Krzysztof Urbański, Brick , Jared Bass, Ashwath Balakrishnan, Halcyon Price
Type: Team weekly

#### Agenda

- Operational (KYC/KYB) update
- How many resources is each committing toward ARDC?
- Potential areas of focus suggested by DAO Advocate
  - Research
    Blockworks and Delphi to figure out who’s gonna tackle what and in what order.
    - Gaming catalyst program
    - STIP/LTIPP Analysis in coordination with Chaos Labs (have 2-3 case studies of protocols by next week)
  - Security
    OpenZeppelin to manage the workload as they see fit, but here’s what we want to see them work on:
    - Escape hatch proposal analysis ([context](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tally-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/21247))
    - Tally expansion proposal - governor contracts ([context](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387))
    - Sequencer ETH
  - Risk
    Chaos Labs to manage workload as they see fit.
    - STIP/LTIPP in coordination with Blockworks/Delphi Digital (have 2-3 case studies of protocols by next week)
    - Staking sequencer’s ETH
  #### Items Discussed
  **Research:**
  - Created a roadmap for the next 12 weeks. To be altered based on DAO Advocate’s feedback
  - Bandwidth from Delphi Digital = 2-3 people majority tasked with ARDC work.
  - Bandwidth from Blockworks = 3 people, subject to change based on needs.
  - Krzysztof to talk with Dan from Vela to determine how ARDC can help.
  - We need to have reasonable expectations on when we can start seeing results from the gaming catalyst program if it’s to pass. From ARDC perspective, we need to understand how we can assess the program itself, what KPIs to set, etc.
  - Blockworks and Delphi to separate workstreams and tasks between them.
  - Crucial to have some early data for the efficacy of the STIP. Some case studies of 2-3 protocols for the next week or 2.
    Security
  - Bandwidth from OpenZepplin = 2 people at 60/70%
  - Expecting results of analysis of the escape hatch proposal within a week from finishing legal procedures.
  - Will keep us updated on KYC/KYB & grant agreement
    **Risk**
  - KYC/KYB almost done
  - Grant agreement in process - should be finalized in the next 24-48 hours
  - Bandwidth from Chaos Labs = 2 people
  - Will update us on the process and expectations for STIP/LTIPP analysis
