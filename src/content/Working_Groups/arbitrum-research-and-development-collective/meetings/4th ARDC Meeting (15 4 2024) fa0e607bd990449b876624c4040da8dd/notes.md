# 4th ARDC Meeting (15.4.2024)

Attendees: Krzysztof Urbański, Muhammad Yusuf, Ashwath Balakrishnan, Brick
Type: Team weekly

### Agenda

- Operational (KYC/KYB) update
- Updates from each member

### Items Discussed

Operational:

- Seems like everyone apart from Delphi has already signed the agreement
- Delphi will update after the call what is the ETA of the paperwork being signed by them
- DAO Advocate will announce the beginning of the 6 month period this week, probably today/tomorrow (depending on the Delphi paperwork ETA)

**Research:**

- we discussed the roadmap that Blockworks prepared
- we want to focus on STIP first, DAO strucute analysis we might want to push for a bit later, salary analysis and STIP unification/patterns are interesting for next goals
- don’t worry too much about potential overlap with OpenBlockLabs
- Blockworks already has a GMX use-case ready, will send it soon for review and feedback to DAO Advocate and to GMX
- it would be good to continue working on other projects, maybe some smaller ones for reference
- Blockworks discussed with Chaos Labs the division of scope for their analysis of STIP, this will be finalized and sent to the group later on
