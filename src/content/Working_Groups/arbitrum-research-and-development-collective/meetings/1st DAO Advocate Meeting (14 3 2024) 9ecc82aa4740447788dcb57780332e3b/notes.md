### 1st DAO Advocate Meeting (14.3.2024)

**Items Discussed:**
Discussed organizational things and agreed on the following:

- The DAO Advocate will publish weekly status update
- L2BEAT will be responsible for updating the forum communication thread
- ARDC x DAO Advocate calls will be open to the public to listen in to
- DAO current topics

**Research** - Gaming Catalyst Program is probably the main priority - Investment arm - framework - DAO Ops Facility - what next? - Hourly rates pricing

    **Risk**

    - STIP
    - monthly ARB price sensitivity (?) report
    - how can we effectively swap ARB to USDC
    - how to build USDC reservres, how big

    **Security**

    - ETH from the sequencer staking
    - ETH from the bridge staking (rather not but this topic was mentioned?)
    - ARB sent to the token contract
