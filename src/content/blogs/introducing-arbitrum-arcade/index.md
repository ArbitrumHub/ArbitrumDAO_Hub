### Creating with Creators

A big part of the Arbitrum Arcade revolves around content creation. To uplift emerging content creators and reward those who generate the most engagement for both themselves and the games, weâ€™ve allocated $200,000 in grants to be equally distributed amongst all creators who participate.

In addition to the $200,000 worth of grants, weâ€™re also giving away 3 fully loaded PCs (up to $5,000 in value) so theyâ€™ll never have to worry about bitrate again. ðŸ˜‰

1st PC will go to the creator with the highest amount of referrals

2nd PC will go to the creator with the highest amount of video content produced

- X, Youtube, Twitch, and Sanko TV, Kick, Tik Tok, and Instagram
- MUST include hashtag #ArbitrumArcade across content on all platforms for posts to be eligible-

3rd PC goes to the creator with the highest number of impressions generated through the total content produced

- X, Youtube, Twitch, and Sanko TV, Kick, Tik Tok, and Instagram
- MUST include hashtag #ArbitrumArcade across content on all platforms for posts to be eligible

To be a creator as part of the Arbitrum Arcade, creators must have created at least 10 to 5 forms of web3 gaming video content (shorts or full-length videos) from X, Youtube, Tik Tok, or Twitch within the last 60 days (before 2/27/2024).

To remain eligible for a part of the $200,000 worth of grants and PC giveaway, content creators must produce at least 1 piece of web3 gaming video content per week related to the participating games for that chapter. Winners will be decided following a manual review of content produced during the campaign.

The Arbitrum Foundation will also join the fun through weekly live streams simulcasted on [X](https://twitter.com/arbitrum) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Arbitrum). Weâ€™re excited to have some of web3â€™s most popular content creators streaming with us throughout the Arcade â€” stay tuned for the names to be announced.

### Onchain Achievements

With the kickoff of the Arbitrum Arcade, weâ€™re introducing an onchain gaming system built by Clique on top of EAS. This system is designed for Arbitrum gamers who want to show off their onchain and offchain achievements across their favorite games within the ecosystem!

EAS on Arbitrum Nova is utilized, allowing open-source contributions from anyone in the community at the infrastructure level. This will live beyond the Arbitrum Arcade, serving as a public good for the Arbitrum community and any gaming community interested in building on top of it for their own gamers.

### Preparing for Arbitrum Arcade

Arbitrum Arcade officially begins on Monday, March 11th! If youâ€™re a user whoâ€™s interested in participating, ensure you have ETH to cover gas fees on Arbitrum One and Nova. If youâ€™re a content creator, ensure your camera is ready to go, and your micâ€™s gain is turned up, and apply to join the Arcade. If youâ€™re a gaming team looking to be part of the campaign, make sure to launch between now and the end of Chapter 4.

GG fam, see you March 11th in the #ArbitrumArcade. ðŸ‘¾
