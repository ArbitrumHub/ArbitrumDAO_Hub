Today, we’re excited to share the Arbitrum Foundation’s first ever grant program. This program is an important step in line with the Foundation’s mission set out by the Foundation’s Bylaws which codifies that the Foundation is responsible for “fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events”. https://arbitrum.foundation/grants

The Arbitrum Foundation’s Grant Program outlines the framework by which the Arbitrum Foundation, in support of the Arbitrum DAO, will allocate grants in line with the directives provided in the mission statement and the Constitutional documents.

This program is called Foundation Grants to clarify that the Arbitrum Foundation runs this program. It should not be confused with any other grant programs authorized by the Arbitrum DAO. It is important to distinguish that the Foundation Grants Program is NOT designed to replace any DAO-driven grants program. This program is run through the Foundation to satisfy the requirements set out in the Foundation’s mission statement towards achieving specific objectives and areas of opportunity identified by the Foundation.

Foundation’s Grants is focused on ecosystem growth and issuing grants towards areas where increased development will potentially see a proportionally greater return to the Arbitrum ecosystem. All grants issued through this program will serve to improve adoption, create stronger technical structures, and build amazing sustainable communities. These grants will be milestone and KPI based, which will be established in collaboration with each applicant.

The Foundation Grant Program will operate in distinct phases,each designed to attract applications from specific areas within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The initial phase places the spotlight on decentralized applications and infrastructure for Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One. You can read more on categories here. If your project does not meet the criteria for the current phase, you are encouraged to submit a proposal to the Arbitrum DAO via the proposal process outlined in the constitution or to revisit this page at a later time as new phases are announced. You can also reach out to grants@arbitrum.foundation.

Applications that are chosen to receive a grant from the Foundation will be given the opportunity to be showcased. The Foundation plans to include major activities of this program under the transparency report as stated in AIP 1.1. The Foundation Grants Program is an ongoing initiative, with a rolling grant acceptance window allowing projects with grant requests to submit them as needed. Phases do not have defined “end dates” from the outset, but can be expected to last for roughly three months or until the Arbitrum Foundation believes the objectives for that phase have been achieved. There will be grant moratorium periods during the year where additional applications will be frozen. These will be announced and disclosed through this Notion page.

We are excited to embark on this journey of supporting projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem through the Foundation Grants Program.

Together, we can foster growth, drive adoption, and build a thriving community, working hand in hand to contribute and shape the future of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
